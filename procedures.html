            <h3>Fire Drills</h3>
              <p>Seema conducts fire drills once a month. She will let you know in the morning if she will do a fire drill that day. In the case of a fire please:</p>
              <div class="row"> 
                <div class="col-md-6">
                  <ul>
                    <li>Have your students line up and go out the door single file.</li>
                    <li>Please bring a first aid kit (which should be kept by the door) and your class roster (in iPad or binder form)</li>
                    <li>Have all students go to your designated "fire spot": for Fulton this spot is the field behind the building, for the Hood Ave campuses this location is the Macadam Bar &amp Grill parking lot</li>
                  </ul>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Keep your class grouped together once you reach the fire spot</li>
                    <li>Make sure all children are present and accounted for and hold up your "all present" sign</li>
                    <li>Wait for fire personnel to tell you it is safe to go back inside the building or wait for further instruction</li>

          <h3>Lock-Down</h3>
            <p>In the case of a lock-down go into your classroom or another space where you can close and all the doors and windows. Close the blinds and lock the doors if possible, stay away from the doors and windows. Keep children calm and quiet. Call 9-1-1 if police have not yet been notified. Wait for authorized personnel. <a target="blank" href="http://www.portlandoregon.gov/911/article/349477">More information</a>.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>You should call 9-1-1 if:
                  <ul>
                    <li>If a child falls off a structure and loses consciousness</li>
                    <li>If a child has an allergic reaction even after you administer an epi-pen</li>
                    <li>If a child is injured in such a way that they are losing a lot of blood from a major artery or vein</li>
                    <li>If there is a fire</li>
                    <li>If you see an individual or group with a weapon near the school</li>
                    <li>If an individual exposes themselves to a student</li>
                    <li>If a child goes missing during the school day</li>

              </div>
              <div class ="col-md-6">
                <p>You should call the non-emergency number (503.823.3333) if:
                  <ul>
                    <li>You see suspicious but non-threatening behavior (i.e. someone walking down the street looking in all the car windows)</li>
                    <li>If you want to dispose of something you feel could be evidence (like when Seema found the bag of porn outside of Hood Ave)</li>
                    <li>To report a burglary that is complete and the suspects are gone (i.e. if the school was broken into overnight)</li>
                    <li>If you are in a potentially criminal situation and feel uncomfortable or unsure of what to do, but don't think it is urgent or dangerous enough to call 9-1-1</li>
                  </ul>

          <h3>Calling Parents</h3>
           <p>Of course you should call parents if their child is involced in any situation involving 9-1-1 or the non-emergency police number. However, there are some other times when you will need to call parents:</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <ul>
                <li>If a student has a temperature over 98.6F (37C)</li>
                <li>If a student throws up</li>
                <li>If a student has a weeping or pink eye (<a target="blank" href="http://www.webmd.com/eye-health/eye-health-conjunctivitis">pink eye</a>)</li>
                <li>If a student is coughing a lot or is so sick they are unable to participate in activities</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <ul>
                <li>If a child develops a rash</li>
                <li>If they are scratching their head a lot and you suspect <a target="blank" href="http://www.webmd.com/children/tc/lice-topic-overview">lice</a>.</li>
                <li>If they hit their head (see "Head Injuries" section)</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>You can find parent contact information in the FileMaker database. This database is loaded on all of the iPads. If for some reason this is not available there is a binder in the front office at all locations with the child authorization forms. Finally you can go directly into a student's file if neither of these options works. Be sure to leave a message on each number you call. If you are calling because a child threw up, has pink eye, lice, or a fever tell the parents they need to come pick up their child right away. These are possible symptoms of highly contagious conditions that could spread throughout the class and possibly the school and CCD requires that they leave the campus immediately to reduce their exposure to other students. If a child's symptoms are severe enough and you do not reach either of the primary contacts continue on to emergency and non-emergency contacts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="concussion">
          <h3>Head Injuries</h3>
            <p>It is school policy to notify parents whenever a child hits their head. If it is obvious the child is fine it is sufficient to just leave a message if you do not reach the primary contact. I like to follow this script: "Hello, this is [insert your name] from L'Etoile French Immersion School. I am calling to let you know that [student] hit their head [describe accident], it is our policy to contact parents whenever there is a head injury. We applied ice and your child calmed down very quickly and appears to be fine now. If it is ok with you we can keep your child here and we will let you know if their condition changes." If a child is showing signs of a concussion call the primary, emergency and non-emergency contacts until you find someone who is able to pick the child up right away. <br>Here are the signs of a concussion:</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-3">
              <ul>
                <li>Balance problems</li>
                <li>Fatigue/sleepiness</li>
                <li>Vomitting</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3">
              <ul>
                <li>Headache</li>
                <li>Difficulty remembering things</li>
                <li>Blurry vision</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Biting</h3>
          <p>If a student bites another student please write incident reports for both children and send an email to the parent of the child who did the biting.</p>
        <h3>Incident Reports</h3>
          <p>If an accident occers that is not serious enough to call a parent but will leave a noticeable mark on the student (bruises, scrapes, cuts, etc) please follow first aid procedure and fill out an incident report. These repots can be found in each classroom and in the back of the AFCA binder.</p>
