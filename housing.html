        <h1>Housing</h1> 
        <h3>Arriving in Portland</h3>
          <p>Welcome to the housing section of the website! The goal of this website is to accquaint you with the various Portland neighborhoods and give you some insight when you are choosing where to live, especially if you have never been to Portland before.</p>

          <p>It is very difficult to arrange housing before you arrive in Portland, most listings come up as they are available or at most 1 month in advance. So, when you arrive there are a few options. You can search for sublets or temporary housing on <a target="blank" hreg="http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/sub/">Craigslist</a>. Note that the search area has already been set for Multnomah County, this is the county around the school. Another short term option is <a target="blank" hreg="https://www.airbnb.com/s/Portland--OR?source=bb">Air BnB</a>. Or you could work out another option with Seema.</p>
        
        <h3>Transportation</h3>
          <p>When you are ready to start your housing search there are a couple of factors that could limit your search, the main one being transportation and distance. If you plan on buying a car your options will expand to less expensive, more suburban areas such as Beaverton, Tigard, Hillsdale, etc. (although personally I would avoid all of these neighborhoods because they are not as fun). There are lots of certified new and used car dealerships where you can find a reasonably priced car. There are also ride share programs such as <a target="blank" href="http://www.zipcar.com/?&gclid=CN2N_Zz_4r0CFRSPfgodYlAAkQ">Zip Car</a> and <a target="blank" href="https://www.car2go.com/en/portland/">Car 2 Go</a>. Zip Car would be a good option if you don't plan on buying a car and have another commute option but would occasionally like to borrow a car to go to the beach, make an Ikea run, etc. Car 2 Go, on the other hand, could be used as a daily commute car (some of our families use them to commute from work and to pick up their kids from school).</p>

          </div>
          <p>Portland is also very bike friendly and has a very intense bike culture (see clip from the popular show <a target="blank" href="http://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia">Portlandia</a>). I highly recommend at least getting a bike for fun when you move to Portland, if not to commute to school. The downfall of commuting by bike: the rain.</p>
          
          <p>And of course there is the public transportation system. While not as advanced as cities in Europe, our public transport (known as TriMet) is excellent for short distances (many teachers use it to commute to and from school). Public transportation methods include the bus, the Max (a somewhat fast train with a designated traffic lane that connects various suburbs with downtown Portland), and the streetcar (a super slow bus on rails, but it only costs $1 to ride it). When you find a place you can use <a target="blank" href="http://trimet.org/howtoride/maptripplanner.htm">TriMet Trip Planner</a> to see how long your commute would be taking any of these public transportation options.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Neighborhoods</h3>
          <p>There are so many fun neighborhoods in Portland. The school is located in the John's Landing neighborhood, which is ideally located about 2 miles from downtown portland and runs right along the Willamette river. Obviously, this would be an ideal place to live: close to the school; access to outdoor activities such as a bike path, kayaking, and tennis courts; close to the center of Portland while still having a quaint, old Portland neighborhood feel; close to bus lines and the streetcar; etc. That said, vacancies in this part of town are rare and range from $1,200+ for a one-bedroom and $800+ for a studio.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Here are some other neighborhoods that I recommend (and some notes about them). Please refer to the picture for their location and rental rates:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Southwest Portland: Southwest portland makes up about half of the downtown area. Located about 1.5-2 miles from L'Etoile it is easily accessible by bike or bus. Portland State University takes up a large part of this area but there is also the Portland Art Museum and the South Park Blocks, a large park where there are markets and events on the weekends.</li>
            <li>Downtown Portland: This area is broken up into two main neighborhoods: The Pearl District and Chinatown. The Pearl District is more upscale (read: bourgeouis) with a lot of new development. It is home to many tech start ups, boutique clothing stores, and gourmet restaurants. Despite the high rent (a one bedroom will run you upwards of $1,800) this area is highly sougth after because it is clean, safe, and the streetcar runs through it. There are some older buildings or income-restricted properties (our equivalent of HLMs) but these apartments are very difficult to get. Head just a couple blocks East towards the river, however, and you will arrive in the Chinatown neighborhood. This area is full of seedy dive bars and Chinese restaurants. But it is also (arguably) the nightlife center of Portland with lots of karaoke bars, night clubs, strip clubs, and gay bars. Rent is cheaper here but you might get stabbed if you leave your apartment late at night.</li>
            <li>Northwest Portland: Northwest Portland is an up and coming neighborhood. Formerly an industrial district with pockets of old Portland charm, new premium condominiums are popping up and bring more of the Pearl bourgeouisie and style to this part of Portland. It is also bringing the rent up but you can still find some cute options if you are willing to stray from the popular 21st and 23rd Avenues. I think this neighborhood best embodies Portland's struggle between bourgeoisie and hipsters, think: dive bars next to fancy fondue restaurants, bike shops next to clothing boutiques, and gourmet dessert restaurants next to pizza shops.</li>
            <li>Southeast Portland: Southeast Portland is made up of a LOT of different neighborhoods. Many of our families and some of our teachers live in Sellwood/Eastmoreland/Westmoreland. This is the furthest South part of Southeast Portland. It is popular with families and staff because it is a quick commute to school whether you are coming by bike or by car, rental prices are decent, and this part of Portland has an old Portland neighborhood feel (not many large apartment buildings, imagine tree-lined streets with 100-year-old homes on it). My favorite part of the Southeast is the Hawthorne/Belmont/Division area. This neighborhood is hit or miss with rent, there are expensive new buildings that will run you $1,400 for a one-bedroom but there are also older apartments available for $700. There are fun bars, cheap restaurants, food trucks, and concert venues. There are other SE neighborhoods like Hollywood and Foster-Powell. These neighborhoods are ok, much like Hawthorne/Belmont/Division but with less charm.</li>
          </ul>
